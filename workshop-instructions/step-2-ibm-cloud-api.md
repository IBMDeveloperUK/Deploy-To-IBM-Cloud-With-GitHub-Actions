# Step 2 - Create an IBM Cloud API Key

In this workshop, we will not be using the management console much. This is all about automation. However, to allow this to happen we need to create an API Key that gives the workflow access to our cloud account.

Start by creating or logging into your [IBM Cloud Account](<LINK-HERE>) (don't worry, it is free and doesn't require a credit / debit card).

![ibm cloud sign up](../workshop-assets/images/?.png "IBM Cloud Sign Up")

Once logged in, head to Manage -> Access (IAM) -> API keys -> Create an IBM Cloud API key

![ibm cloud manage](../workshop-assets/images/?.png "IBM Cloud Manage")

![ibm cloud api keys](../workshop-assets/images/?.png "IBM Cloud API Keys")

![ibm cloud create api key](../workshop-assets/images/?.png "IBM Cloud Create API Key")

Give the API key a name and an optional description. Click `Create` and make a note of this key. You will only see it once in this management console.

This is all we need to do in the Cloud console. The rest will be done via the CLI and in GitHub!
